Improvements
==

* More control parameters; explicit water box size
* Configuration object to be passed around, instead of reading the config file in each module.

Features
== 

* Clustering analysis. Potentially see "Going beyond Clustering in MD Trajectory Analysis: An Application to Villin Headpiece Folding".. more litterature research required
