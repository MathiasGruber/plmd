Improvements
==

* More control parameters; explicit water box size
* GPU runs

Features
== 

* Clustering analysis. Potentially see "Going beyond Clustering in MD Trajectory Analysis: An Application to Villin Headpiece Folding".. more litterature research required

Ideas for clustering: implement both DBscan & hiearchy algorithms. Additionally, also implement cluster analysis using Bio3D R package
